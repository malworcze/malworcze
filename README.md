## Projects

### Alert Creator
A simple JavaScript project that creates custom alerts with user input.  
_Motto: Make your browser scream._

### Noteblock Music
Touhou songs recreated in Minecraft note blocks. Painful, meticulous, and oddly satisfying.

### Personal Portfolio Website
This repository! A simple dark-mode portfolio showing my work so far.  
_Totally more coherent than Touhou canon._

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
