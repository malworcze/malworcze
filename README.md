## About Me

Hi! I'm **Malword**, a developer, student, and obsessive tinkerer. I like building small projects, experimenting with web stuff, and occasionally making Touhou songs in Minecraft noteblocks because why not suffer voluntarily.

- 💻 Web Development
- 🎵 Noteblock Music (Touhou covers)
- 🎨 Fun experiments & personal projects

## Projects

### Alert Creator
A simple JavaScript project that creates custom alerts with user input.  
_Motto: Make your browser scream._

### Noteblock Music
Touhou songs recreated in Minecraft note blocks. Painful, meticulous, and oddly satisfying.

### Personal Portfolio Website
This repository! A simple dark-mode portfolio showing my work so far.  
_Totally more coherent than Touhou canon._

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
